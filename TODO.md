# TODOs
* Add class definition checks - Remove runtime checks and improve
  performance
* Add compound byte field structure (One byte divided among several fields)
* Add Type access casting (Have a char be viewed as an integer)
* Add constant structure (A field that always has the same value)
* Add reflection structure (A structure that reflects the value of
  another structure)
* Add conditional structure (Functions as one of several structure
  depending on a condition)?
